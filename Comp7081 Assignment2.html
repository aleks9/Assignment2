<h1>
    Introduction of the project
</h1>
<p>
    This document covers the analysis and design tasks of a software application to be developed for a car rental company. The purpose of this application is
    to manage information about vehicles available for rental, the various transactions for rentals, the companyâ€™s customers, and the users of the software
    application. The application will also allow SuperRent to manage the sale of older rental vehicles as used cars. This document is intended to be given to
    the software developers so that they can begin development on the software.
</p>
<p>
    The particular scope of the application that this document focuses on is the tasks and functions that will be handled by clerks at various SuperRent
    locations. When a rental vehicle is returned by a customer, a clerk enters the date, time and the odometer reading. The clerk also makes a note of whether
    the gas tank is full. The software application calculates the charges by applying weekly rates to whole weeks, daily rate to remaining days and hourly rate
    to additional hours.
</p>
<p>
    The application or the specific module for clerks should allow clerks to perform the following tasks:
</p>
<p>
    -Show the vehicles of a specified category which are available for rental at a given location for a given set of time period (given as beginning and end
    dates)
</p>
<p>
    -Show the vehicles rented from a given location and category which have not been returned past the scheduled return date.
</p>
<p>
    -Show the vehicles at a given location and category that are for sales along with their sale prices
</p>
<p>
    -If a category is not selected, vehicles in all available categories are displayed, grouped by category.
</p>
<p>
    -If a SuperRent location is not selected, rental vehicles available at all locations are shown, grouped by location.
</p>

<p>
    When a clerk starts the application, it will require login credentials before the clerk can use the application. After a clerk enters his / her correct
    username &amp; password combination, the software will load the appropriate module for a clerk.
</p>
<h1>
    Background
</h1>
<p>
    SuperRent is a vehicle rental company. The company began operations in 2003 with two locations. Through steady growth in the last ten years, SuperRent has
    locations in various cities across the country. Its headquarters are located in Burnaby, BC. SuperRent operates regional offices as well to better manage
    and run its vehicle rental locations.
</p>
<p>
    Each location has an assortment of vehicles available for customers to rent. The available car types consist of the following: economy, compact, mid-size,
    standard, full-size, premium, luxury, SUV, and van. SuperRent also has trucks available in various sizes; 24 foot, 15 foot, 12 foot, box trucks, cargo
    vans. The vehicles available for rental have varying features and options to meet the needs of its customers. The different types of vehicles have
    different hourly, daily, and weekly rates, as well as different rates based on distance driven (charged for extra kilometers driven above the limit). The
    company offers varying insurance coverage options for hourly, daily, and weekly rentals for its fleet of cars and trucks.
</p>
<p>
    SuperRent offers to its customers fairly new and well maintained vehicles for rental. Any vehicle that surpasses 80,000 kilometers on the odometer reading
    is taken out of the rental inventory. These used cars are made available for sale to allow the company to acquire capital and the space to purchase new
    vehicles for rental.
</p>

<h1>
    Process model
</h1>
<p>
    This document focuses on a single module of the car rental system software being developed for SuperRent Car Rental Company and that module is the one that
    will be used by clerks. The incremental process model has been chosen for this module of the software application. The incremental process model works best
    for this situation where the module for clerks is being developed sort of separately from the rest of the car rental system. Initially, an early version of
    the clerks module will be delivered to the teams working on the remaining car rental system components to see how it works in the larger application. As
    development on the module progress through various stages, there will be tests to see how it functions and interacts with other modules in the car rental
    system. Some of these testing activities may result anywhere from minor to major modifications to the module. Through the development of the application,
    an increment of the clerks module will first be delivered to teams working on other components of the application to be integrated with the main
    application and then an increment of the application will be delivered to the clients for review.
